Given these descriptions, give me some concrete enumerated (up to 5) developer tasks. Make sure
these can be tracked back to the domain concepts.

For each task, list:

- Name
- Description
- Related domain concepts
- Complexity
- Dependencies, should other tasks be solved first? Answer with dependency name and number
- How the problem should be solved using any of OCore Services, DataEntities and Events
- Concrete events that should be emitted as part of the task, if none leave blank
- Estimate in man-hours
- Uncertainties, if any (these will be sent back to stakeholders). If there are no uncertainties, leave this blank.
- Which kind of developer this is suited for (junior, senior, etc). Answer only with the title of the developer
