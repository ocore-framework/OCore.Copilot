Given the presented tasks, provide a list of events the system
should emit. These events should be named in the past tense; `SomethingHappened`.

It is better that you create too many events than too few. Anything you think
the system should be alerted about should be added.

Itemize the Events starting with "-" and an event name in PascalCase, followed by a colon ":" 
and a description of the Event.
