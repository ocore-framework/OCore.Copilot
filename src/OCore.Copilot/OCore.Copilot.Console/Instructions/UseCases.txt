For the developer to better understand how to implement this system, we need
to break it up into use-cases. Given the previously defined concepts, actors and 
system description, provide me with 3 concrete use-cases that can be used
to show how the system should work.

For each use-case, list actors, related concepts. Itemize the steps in the use-case.

Keep it terse.
