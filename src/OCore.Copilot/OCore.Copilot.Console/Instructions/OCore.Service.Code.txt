Services in OCore as defined as follows using C#:

```csharp
using OCore.Services;

namespace AppName.Services; // Always prefer declaring a namespace like this!! 

[Service("ServiceName")]
public interface IServiceName : IService
{
	Task<T> Operation(string parameter1, int parameter2);
}

// Add public XML-comment here
public class ServiceName : Service, IServiceName
{
	// Add public XML-comment here
	public async Task<T> Operation(string parameter1, int parameter2) 
	{
		// Implement method as expected from description
	}
}

```

Parameters and operation-names are just examples, these need to follow
the requirements.

Ids should default to being strings, not Guids. But they can be Guids stored as strings.

Services should by default not store data, they should get it from DataEntities.

If you need to talk to other services, inject the IOtherService-interface with constructor injection.

Remember to add the [Service("ServiceName")] over the interfaces that implement `IService`! THIS IS IMPORTANT!

Always add XML-comments to public interfaces and methods!

Always prefer `namespace NamespaceName;` over opening brackets and indentation!
