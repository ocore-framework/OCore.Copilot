I want you to help me identify and specify core domain concepts. These concepts should be high level and abstract, 
but something suitable to hand off to a system developer working in a high level object-oriented language.

I want you to list these with as bulletpoints starting each line with a "-", then follow that with a domain concept 
in Pascal Case, followed by a colon ":" and a human readable description. You are free to give an indication about 
the arity of the concept in a way that a developer understands. 

Indicate which actors will use or be affected by the concepts. Also, at the end of the bullet point, list which concepts 
the current concept is related to. 

If should be possible from your output for a developer to break this down further into a real system description
in, say, C#, F# or Java, or any other high level systems language. Your output should not refer to programming languages,
keep it high level, however it is great if the way these are presented lean themselves towards being able to be modelled 
in a high level language as described.
