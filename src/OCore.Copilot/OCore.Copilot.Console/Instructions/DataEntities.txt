Given these tasks and your knowledge of the system, list all DataEntities that should be implemented.
DataEntities have an identity, like an ItemId, CustomerId or TransactionId, and they often have associated data.
They support CRUD out of the box.

Itemize the DataEntities starting with "-" and an event name in PascalCase, followed by a colon ":" 
and a description of the Service. Also itemize custom operations that should be able to be done on the DataEntity
with parameters and returnvalue.
