Given these tasks and your knowledge of the system, list all Services that should be implemented.
Do not suggest a Service if the same problem is better handled by a DataEntity.

Itemize the Services starting with "-" and an event name in PascalCase, followed by a colon ":" 
and a description of the Service. Also itemize suitable operations that should be made on the Service with parameters
and returnvalue. Parameters and return values should be valid .NET types, including complex types like classes and
records.
